# Checkers

Developed with Unreal Engine 4

Controls:
Use the arrow keys to select a location on the grid, and press R-Ctrl to activate a piece. Same controls to select a move for the checker--jumping and "kinging" happens automatically when appropriate. Reselect your current piece to return to grid selection.
Press ESC to close the game.
